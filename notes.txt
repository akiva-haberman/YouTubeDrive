Current method is a little silly. Taking bytes converting them into pixels and filling out an array. Idealy we could just save
the file under a different format an it would be interpretted differently. Problem is i don't really know how PNG's are saved or if 
things are that simple. So now to decode I have to read pixel by pixel. Got it. 

First Goal I want to do right now:
1. start pushing to github
2. reconstruct PDFs based on bytes

Encode TODO:
1. If file is big, save in multiple PNGs
2. Convert PNGs to video format

Decode TODO:
1. have it read the metadata at first to reconstruct the proper file type/reconstruct based on file type
2. be able to use pixel size greater than 1 
3. take in video -> convert to pngs -> the reconstruct
