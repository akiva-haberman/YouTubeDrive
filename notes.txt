Current method is a little silly. Taking bytes converting them into pixels and filling out an array. Idealy we could just save
the file under a different format an it would be interpretted differently. Problem is i don't really know how PNG's are saved or if 
things are that simple. So now to decode I have to read pixel by pixel. Got it. 

First Goals I want to do right now:
3. other file types like photos??

Encode TODO:
1. If file is big, save in multiple PNGs
   - new function that breaks up the data into even (except one maybe) size and puts into images 
   - if all images have metaData will make slightly easier for me... so i'll be lazy right now
2. Convert PNGs to video format

Decode TODO:
3. take in video -> convert to pngs -> the reconstruct 


cool idea if all 3 color values were teh same byte you could have some sort of error correction by choosing the common value...
